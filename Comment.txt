All methods in the businesslogic project are covered with unit tests.
Used Dependency injection (Autofac) and Mock technology.
Almost there are no comments because program is quite simple and I assumed that everythin should be clear from the names of functions.
Didn't spend much time on UI because it was said in requirements.
Enjoy :)
